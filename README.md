Dataset: Secondary Mushroom
The Secondary Mushroom Dataset is a simulated mushroom data collection designed for binary classification tasksâ€”specifically, distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms. It is as an extension to the original UCI Mushroom Dataset, offering a more extensive and diverse set of features to support advanced machine learning applications
